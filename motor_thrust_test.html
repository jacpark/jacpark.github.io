<h1>Desert Sparrow</h1>
<h2>Motor Thrust Test<h2>
<h3>Team: Jacob Parks, Benjamin Branch, Johyl Green</h3>
<body>
<p><b>Why are we doing this lab?</b></p>
<p>By determining the thrust of our motors we are able to see how much our quad is able to lift. Once we know the weight of the quad as well we can calculate at what speed the motors will begin to lift the quad into the air.</p>
<p><b>Materials:</b></p>
<P>Arduino uno</p>
<P>Brushless motor</p>
<P>LiPo battery</p>
<P>Our thrust test rig</p>
<P>Arduino IDE</p>
<p>Electronic Speed Control</p>
<p>Scale</p>
<p>Potentiomiter</p>
<p><b>Lab Procedure</b></p>
<p>Gather all materials</p>
<p>Write and upload some code so that the speed of the motor is based on the position of the potentiometer</p>
<p>Charge LiPo battery</p>
<p>Attach motor test rig to scale</p>
<p>Solder a connector onto an ESC so that it can be plugged into the battery</p>
<p>Attach a motor to the rig and plug it in</p>
<p>Turn up the pot to full power and check the scale</p>
<p>Repeat with the other 3 motors</p>
<p><b>Results</b></p>
<p><b>Motor 1:</b> 1.1kg  |  1.1kg  | 1.2kg </p>
<p><b>Motor 2:</b> 1.1kg  |  1.1kg  | 1.0kg </p>
<p><b>Motor 3:</b> 1.1kg  |  1.2kg  | 1.kg </p>
<p><b>Motor 4:</b> 1.0kg  |  1.1kg  | 1.2kg </p>
    <p>On the very first test our battery was almost dead. We got readings around 100grams.</p>
    <p>Before it died completely. Once we were fully charged there was a big improvment in thrust and the consistansy of that thrust.</p>
